# molecule

_molecule_ acts on whole database across all tables in database.

Packages include:

- Package to process complex RESTful actions using _Molecule_: [godbi](https://godoc.org/github.com/genelet/molecule/tree/master/godbi)
- To auto generate a simple molecule from database: [rdb](https://github.com/genelet/molecule/tree/master/rdb). This is a good starting point for first-time users.
- Instead of JSON, _Molecule_ can be prepresented by protobuf called _Graph_: [gometa](https://github.com/genelet/molecule/tree/master/gometa)
